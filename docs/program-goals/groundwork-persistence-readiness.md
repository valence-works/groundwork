# Groundwork Persistence Readiness

Status: completed.

Area: provider-neutral persistence framework / host integration examples.

Steward(s): Joey plus active architects/agents.

## Purpose

Create a focused coordination bucket for Groundwork, a standalone provider-neutral persistence framework with optional host integration examples.

This bucket keeps generic Groundwork framework work separate from host-specific integrations and from workflow runtime hot-path decisions.

## In Scope

- Groundwork product boundary and package map.
- Provider-neutral storage manifests, storage units, storage intent, provider capability reports, materialization plans, and schema history.
- Portable document storage and declared-index query semantics.
- Provider packages for SQLite, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- Host integration examples that validate Groundwork through application stores.
- Runtime-defined entity storage once the generic document/index contract is proven.
- Physicalization and performance evaluation.
- Runtime-store go/no-go evaluation where Groundwork may or may not be appropriate.

## Out Of Scope

- Treating workflow runtime hot paths as automatic Groundwork migrations.
- Folding queues, execution logs, outbox records, timers, or distributed locks into ordinary document storage without benchmark evidence.
- Adding host-specific domain concepts to generic Groundwork packages.
- Replacing existing application persistence paths without an opt-in migration plan.

## Completed Objectives

1. Complete [Groundwork Persistence Foundation](../../specs/012-groundwork-persistence-foundation/plan.md) as the G0 product-definition slice.
2. Complete [Groundwork Core Manifest And Planner Kernel](../../specs/013-groundwork-core-manifest-planner/plan.md) as the G1 implementation slice.
3. Complete [Groundwork SQLite Document Store](../../specs/014-groundwork-sqlite-document-store/plan.md) as the G2 provider validation slice.
4. Complete [Groundwork Host Integration Bridge](../../specs/015-groundwork-host-integration-bridge/plan.md) as the G3 opt-in host integration slice.
5. Complete [Groundwork SQL Server And PostgreSQL Providers](../../specs/016-groundwork-relational-providers/plan.md) as the G4 relational provider slice.
6. Complete [Groundwork MongoDB Provider](../../specs/017-groundwork-mongodb-provider/plan.md) as the G5 document-provider slice.
7. Complete [Groundwork Runtime-Defined Entities](../../specs/018-groundwork-runtime-entities/plan.md) as the G6 runtime-defined business data slice.
8. Complete [Groundwork Physicalization And Performance](../../specs/019-groundwork-physicalization-performance/plan.md) as the G7 provider-optimization slice.
9. Complete [Groundwork Runtime Evaluation And Hardening](../../specs/020-groundwork-runtime-evaluation-hardening/plan.md) as the final go/no-go slice.
10. Preserve the original Persistence vNext roadmap by mapping each slice to a Groundwork-first execution slice.
11. Defer runtime hot-path migration until benchmark and concurrency evidence exists.

## Current Roadmap Notes

- G0 defines the product and planning boundary only.
- G1 adds generic Groundwork core/planner packages and tests before any host-specific store migration.
- G2 adds the first provider-backed portable document store using SQLite.
- G3 adds an opt-in host integration bridge and validates a Secrets-like manifest through SQLite without replacing existing persistence paths.
- G4 adds SQL Server and PostgreSQL providers against the same portable document-store contract.
- G5 adds MongoDB native collections and declared indexes against the portable document-store contract.
- G6 adds a host integration runtime-defined entity mapping over portable document storage.
- G7 proves opt-in physicalization paths without making physical tables the runtime-defined entity default.
- G8 records runtime-store go/no-go decisions and preserves benchmark, concurrency, retry, and operational gates before any runtime hot-path migration.
- Storage that needs behavior beyond the portable document contract remains benchmark-gated or provider-specialized by default.

## Drift / Review Notes

- If work becomes mostly workflow runtime architecture, route it through [Runtime Execution Seam](runtime-execution-seam.md).
- If work becomes mostly packaging or repository mechanics, route it through [Workspace Split Readiness](workspace-split-readiness.md).
- If a Groundwork rule becomes a general framework quality gate, move it to the constitution and leave a link here.

## Removal or Completion Conditions

Complete or pause this bucket when Groundwork has reached a stable provider/document-store foundation with remaining work tracked in implementation-specific specs.
